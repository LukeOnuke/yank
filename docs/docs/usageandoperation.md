# Quick start usage and operation guide
This will all be discussed in more detail but this is the
essentials.

## Operation
This section starts you off on operating the yank backend.
### What java version yank requires?

- Java 11+
## How yank handles the server?
Currently yank will run the server and will close when the
server closes, this will change in a future version, but
currently it is what it is.
## Can I use tunity, purpur, paper, etc?
***Yes***, as yank handles it as a subprocess, this will be 
elaborated further in the advanced section.

## Usage
The ui is split in two pages
### Console
Console also serves as the index and looks like this

server.

### Status

It pings (or queries) the server for game info, when there
are players online on the server the players page will have
clickable links to a namemc query page of that player.

For example, if we click on `Fluid64` it will lead us to 
this page https://namemc.com/profile/Fluid64. Also 
`Fluid64` is just a random player on one of our beta testers
server, please don't bother him/her(or whatever the users
preferred pronouns are).
